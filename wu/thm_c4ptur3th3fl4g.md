   * pretty sure it was ascii right away, but could get it to decode with anything on cyber chef.
   * so I did it by hand using a searched ascii table
   * once decoded the flag showed me, its call BCD. Thats a thing on cyber chef, but I cant get it to decode.

   * finaly layer is ascii again, which I *again* decoded by hand.

### Spectrograms
* Downloaded task file
* searched a bit for spectrum analyzer online
* uploaded file, got the flag <https://academo.org/demos/spectrum-analyzer/>

### Steganography
* Downloaded task file
* searched for steganography decoder online jpg
* found some pages that didnt work
* found this <https://www.futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html> 
* got the flag

### Security through obscurity 
* Downloaded task file
* opened the file in a text editor, scrolled to the end and found the filename & extension for the first flag.
* however I didnt find the archive or another hidden text
* eventually I found this nice collection <https://0xrick.github.io/lists/stego/>
* tried steghide, which didnt really help, because it assumes encrypted content
* tried foremost, which found the inner picture.
* this led me to believe the inner picture has another layer of steganography inside it, which would be the final flag
* after some frustrating hours trying to find the missing flag with binwalk, which found some zlib archiv, that turned out to be the picture encoding
* I circled back and used strings on the file, turns out the flag was right next to the first one after all

### Conclusion
great fun and because its based on encoding, you always know there is something.
